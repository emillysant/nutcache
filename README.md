# Project 
Project for front-end developer.

It consists of creating an employee form by consuming a public API (https://crudcrud.com).

## Required
### implement a people registration popup
### implement a main page with a grid listing
### implement a create employee popup
### implement a confirmation poppup to delete
### implement a edit employee popup
### implement a button to delete employees
### implement a button to edit employees

## Problems
Because the API had a limited number of requests, I was not able to test the update function (Endpoint has exceeded allowed number of requests (100)).

I had CORS error using this API, so I managed to test only the get and post methods.

I need to style the form

I need to put a confirmation button to delete employee
